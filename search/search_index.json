Vimwiki is a great tool for creating a personal wiki although it is limited as static website generator. It basically turns a markdown wiki into a set of html pages. Hugo on the other hand is a very comprehensive static website generator that can be used to create a multitude of different websites and is therefore much more difficult to get up and running.
