# My Personal Development (2022)

I have a professional interest in following areas ...

- Education 
- Mathematics
- Technology
- Engineering
- Science
- Management

... and how they all are all inter-linked.

Much of our education was based on a reductionist model. New developments in education have taken a more holistic view and uses a systems thinking approach to tackle future challenges. 

In order for this paradigm shift to take place we need to ensure that education provides our students with the transformative skills that they will need to face their future.

## <u>How do I keep up to date with future developments?</u>

## <u>A final thought</u>

On first sight the film "Moneyball" is just an enjoyable film, but on further inspection it turns out to be a great resource for understanding what analytics is all about.

The opportunities for learning are all around us. As educators it is our responsibility to open up this world so that the next generation can experience it for themselves.
