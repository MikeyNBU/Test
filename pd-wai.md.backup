# My Personal Development

I have a professional interest in following areas ...

- Education 
- Mathematics
- Technology
- Engineering
- Science
- Management

... and how they all are all inter-linked.

Much of our education was based on a reductionist model. New developments in education have taken a more holistic view and use a systems thinking approach to tackle future challenges. 

In order for this paradigm shift to take place we need to ensure that education provides our students with the transformative skills that they will need to face their future.

I regularly purchase a the following magazines

- [Linux Format]()
- [Linux Magazine]()
- [New Scientist]()

(Note: A lot of the content within the linux magazines, which go back to 2003, are still very relevant today)

... and of course, working next to a library, I have access to a vast array of books and journals

## A final thought

On first sight the film "Moneyball" is just an enjoyable film, but on further inspection it turns out to be a great resource for understanding what analytics is all about.

The opportunities for learning are all around us. As educators it is our responsibility to open up this world so that everyone can experience it fully for themselves.
